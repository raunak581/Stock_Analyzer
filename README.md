# 📈 Flutter Stock Analyzer App

A real-time stock price tracker built with Flutter and Riverpod. The app connects to a WebSocket server, updates stock prices live, detects price anomalies using heuristics, and displays connection/network status.

## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Flutter 3.x+
- Dart 3.x+
- WebSocket server running at `ws://<your-ip>:8080/ws`

### Getting Started
1. **Clone the repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/stock-analyzer.git
   cd stock-analyzer
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**  
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **Run the app**
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

4. **Run tests**
   ```bash
   flutter test
   ```

## 🧠 Architectural Decisions

### 🧱 State Management: `Riverpod`
We chose Riverpod for its:
- Performance: fine-grained listening with `.select` avoids unnecessary rebuilds.
- Scalability: separates business logic cleanly from UI.
- Robustness: supports unit testing and lifecycle safety.

### 📂 Project Structure
```
lib/
│
├── main.dart
├── stock.dart                  # Enums, models (e.g., ConnectionStatus)
├── Stock_provider.dart         # StockNotifier + StateNotifierProvider
├── stock_Analyzer.dart        # Main UI & state subscriptions
```

### 🔄 Separation of Concerns
- **Data Layer**: WebSocket and connectivity logic is in `StockNotifier`.
- **UI Layer**: Stateless/Consumer widgets using `.select` to rebuild only what’s needed.
- **Logic Layer**: Heuristic filtering, flash color state, reconnection logic, anomaly handling in `StockNotifier`.

## ⚠️ Anomaly Detection Heuristic

### 🔍 Rule
> If the price of a stock drops **more than 90%** compared to its previous value within a second, it is marked as **anomalous**.

### ✅ Behavior
- **Anomalous prices are ignored.** The app continues to display the last known good value.
- **A warning icon appears** next to the stock, flagging it as "suspect".

### ⚖️ Trade-offs
| Scenario | Outcome | Notes |
|---------|---------|-------|
| Legitimate market crash | False positive | May delay displaying real crashes |
| Short spike recovery | True negative | Correctly maintains prior price |
| Malformed data | Ignored | Prevents app crashes |

This conservative heuristic favors **stability and trustworthiness** in the UI over hypersensitivity to rapid market events.

## ⚡️ Performance Analysis

### ✅ DevTools Overlay Screenshot

### 💡 Optimization Summary
- **Rebuild Minimization**: `.select()` ensures widgets only rebuild on relevant changes.
- **Flash Indicator**: Isolated in its own `ConsumerStatefulWidget` with internal timers.
- **Suspect Flag**: Stored separately (`Set<String>`) to avoid touching price map unnecessarily.
- **Connection Awareness**: Built-in internet detection and reconnect logic prevents crashes.

### ✅ Result
- UI stays smooth even under heavy WebSocket traffic (updates every second).
- **No raster jank**. Frame render times stay well below 16ms (green bars in overlay).
